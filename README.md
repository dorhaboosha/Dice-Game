# Dice Game
This is a simple yet engaging dice game developed in JavaScript, featuring two diceâ€”one for each player.

The game begins with a page refresh, which triggers the dice to roll, and the player with the higher score emerges as the winner.

The randomization of dice on each refresh ensures a fair and exciting challenge every time.
